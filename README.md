What problem are you intending to solve?
----------------------------------------

TodayÂ´s world lacks the presence of distributed systems capable of processing the ever increasing amounts of information being generated by many sensors located at different locations....

Well at least that was the high level goal that we planned for a week ago. But for the purpose of the Hackathon, we just really wanted to have some fun hacking and experimenting with sensor networks and the Facebook API.

What sensors did you use?
------------------------

* [WeatherDuck by ITWatchDogs](www.itwatchdogs.com/DataSheets/WxDuxDataSheet051003.pdf) - We utilized the light, humidity, temperature and contact sensors.
* [Arduino Uno with Ethernet Shield](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) - We used this to create the actuators to react when the sensors were above a certain threshold (we didn't have time to fully integrate this though).

What Facebook technologies did you use?
---------------------------------------

* [The Javascript SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/) - for authentication
* [The OpenGraph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) - for posting sensor data to pages

How do things work?
-------------------

Each sensor will post its data to its own dedicated Facebook page. Specifically, we have a (test) account each for the light, humidity, temperature and contact sensors. The sensors post their data at different intervals depending on their rate of change.
There will be a parent account called the "Home" that will monitor all the sensors that belongs to it and checks for anomalies in the readings.

Here's a concrete demonstration (that we did during the final presentation) of how things could work in a real setting.

Imagine a home equipped with different sensors monitoring it. Some of these sensors could be used to make the house more comfortable (e.g., detecting that the temperature is uncomfortably warm and subsequently turning the A/C on). Some of the sensors could be used for security features (e.g., detecting that a door or window has been opened forcibly and, thus, alerting the user and authorities). 

Many of such sensors exist already but they are often hardcoded into a tightly coupled system. We were trying to investigate and experiment with ways to create a federated form of sensor networks using the Facebook platform.

Caveat Emptor
-------------

The code was hacked together in less than 24 hours and thus exhibit the most pungent of code smells: it suffers from lots of code duplication and questionable design. However, it is still a useful reference for hobbyist and tinkerers looking to hook up sensors with Facebook.
